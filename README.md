# AI-Driven Shipment Forecasting for Warehouse Operations Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops an **AI-driven shipment (outbound volume) forecasting system** designed to support
**warehouse and logistics operations decision-making**.

Rather than focusing solely on prediction accuracy, the project emphasizes how AI-based forecasts
can be translated into **operational insights**, such as:
- Reducing shipment delays and stockout risks
- Improving warehouse capacity planning
- Minimizing operational and logistics costs

The framework is designed to be **scalable and applicable across U.S. supply chain and logistics industries**.

---

## 🎯 Motivation & National Interest Relevance
Efficient logistics and warehouse operations are critical to:
- Supply chain resilience
- Cost reduction in distribution networks
- Timely delivery of goods across industries

This project demonstrates how **AI-powered demand forecasting** can enhance
**operational efficiency and decision-making**, contributing to:
- Reduced shipment delays
- Lower operational waste
- Improved stability in supply chain systems

The proposed approach aligns with U.S. national interests by promoting
**technology-driven optimization of logistics infrastructure**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Warehouse operations face significant challenges due to:
- Uncertain outbound shipment volumes
- Sudden demand spikes causing capacity overload
- Underutilization of labor and logistics resources

**Key Question:**
> How can AI-based shipment forecasting be used to proactively optimize warehouse operations and reduce operational risk?

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Shipment Forecasting (AI Models)
- Baseline models: Moving Average, Naive Forecast
- Machine learning models:
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
- Features include:
  - Historical shipment volumes
  - Calendar effects (day of week, seasonality, holidays)
  - Lagged demand and rolling statistics

### 2. Operational Risk Translation
Forecast outputs are converted into operational metrics:
- Shipment delay risk
- Capacity overload probability
- Required buffer capacity for peak periods

### 3. Cost-Based Simulation
A cost framework is applied to evaluate operational impact:
- Under-forecast cost: delayed shipments, expedited logistics
- Over-forecast cost: idle labor and unused warehouse capacity

Performance is evaluated based on **total operational cost reduction**, not only forecast accuracy.

---

## 📊 Key Evaluation Metrics
- Forecast accuracy (MAPE, RMSE)
- Stockout and delay risk reduction
- Total operational cost savings
- Stability of warehouse capacity utilization

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes
- Improved shipment volume forecasting using AI models
- Reduced shipment delay and stockout risk
- Lower warehouse operational costs through proactive planning
- A reusable decision-support framework for logistics operations

---

## 🚀 Future Extensions
- Integration with inventory optimization (ROP & safety stock)
- Real-time forecasting with streaming data
- Reinforcement learning for dynamic capacity allocation
- Deployment as an API or dashboard for operational teams

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- Time-series feature engineering
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📜 Disclaimer
This project uses publicly available or synthetic data for research and demonstration purposes.
The framework is designed to be adaptable to real-world warehouse and logistics environments.
